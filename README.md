# Pulsy Atria Library

The Atria Library is a curated collection of ready-to-use DeFi feed templates for [Pulsy Atria](https://pulsy.app/atria).

This library is constantly evolving as we add new feeds across multiple chains and protocols.

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to create a pull request with new feeds or improvements.
